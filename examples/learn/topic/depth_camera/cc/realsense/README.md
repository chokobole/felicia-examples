# Depth Camera(Realsense)

**Tested using D435i**

**Supported on Windows and Linux**

Here you need three terminals, each for running the master server, publisher and subscriber.

Before beginning, let's build the binary.

```bash
bazel build --define has_realsense=true @com_github_chokobole_felicia//felicia/core/master/rpc:master_server_main
bazel build --define has_realsense=true //examples/learn/topic/depth_camera/cc:depth_camera_node_creator
```

Done. Now let's begin and run the server!

```bash
bazel-bin/external/com_github_chokobole_felicia/felicia/core/master/rpc/master_server_main
```

We don't explain the same we had in [README.md](/examples/learn/topic/camera/cc/README.md).

```bash
bazel-bin/examples/learn/topic/depth_camera/cc/depth_camera_node_creator -l
# For example on linux
device_list is on, it just shows a list of camera devices. If you pass -i(--device_index) with the -l then you can iterate the camera formats the device supports.
[0] display_name: Intel RealSense D435I device_id: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-7/2-7.2/2-7.2.1/2-7.2.1:1.0/video4linux/video0 model_id: 0B3A
```

If you run with the program by passing `-l -i 0`.

```bash

Unlike camera example, there's a lot to control with. If you want to turn on `imu` sensor, you have to pass `--imu_topic`. But watch out that if you publish imu topic as it emits, the other streams can be starved. Also `realsense2` library provide us with synchronously accepting color and depth stream. You can employ this feature by passing `--synched`.
